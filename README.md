# Operating System Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of three CPU scheduling algorithms: Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the individual algorithm files using a C++ compiler.
